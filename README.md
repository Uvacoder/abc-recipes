# 👨‍🍳 Recipes

🔗 https://recipes.sebastiandedeyne.com

A collection of recipes I frequently revisit. I never really was happy with other apps or note taking solutions for recipes, so decided to use markdown files and build a little site from them.

## Tech specs

- Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Recipes are stored as markdown, and transformed to JavaScript objects using a [custom webpack loader](https://github.com/sebastiandedeyne/recipes.sebastiandedeyne.com/blob/master/build/recipe-loader.js)
- Vanilla CSS with some column and grid goodness
- Hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
