# Garlic bread

- 5 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup flat parsley leaves
- 200 g butter
- 1 tbsp garlic powder dissolved in 3 tbsp water

Combine to make garlic butter.

- Ciabatta

Slice ciabatta. Keep te parts together and arrange like fallen dominoes on a piece of aluminium foil.

Heat garlic butter until pourable, and pour over ciabatta. Close up the foil.

Place in a 200Â° C oven for 15-20 minutes. Then open up the foil, and broil until crispy on top.
