# Martha Stewart's One-Pan Pasta

- 340 g linguine
- 340 g cherry or grape tomatoes, halved or quartered if large
- 1 onion, thinly sliced (about 2 cups)
- 4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 2 sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for garnish
- 2	tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving

- 4 1/2 cups water

Combine pasta, tomatoes, onion, garlic, red-pepper flakes, basil, oil, 2 teaspoons salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and water in a large straight-sided skillet (the linguine should lay flat).

Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil mixture, stirring and turning pasta frequently with tongs or a fork, until pasta is al dente and water has nearly evaporated, about 9 minutes.

- A few slices of parma ham

Grill for a few minutes until crunchy.

Season to taste with salt and pepper, divide among 4 bowls, and garnish with basil. Serve with olive oil, fresh basil and ham.
