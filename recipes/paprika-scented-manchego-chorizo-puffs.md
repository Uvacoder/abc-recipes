# Manchego chorizo puffs

Makes 24 puffs.

- 3/4 cup chorizo, finely diced
- 3/4 cup manchego cheese, finely diced
- 1/4 cup scallions, thinly sliced

Preheat oven to 375Â° F. In a bowl, combine chorizo, cheese, and scallions. Set aside.

- 1 cup water
- 1 stick unsalted butter, cut into cubes
- 1/4 teaspoon iodized salt

In a heavy saucepan, bring water, 1/4 tsp. salt, and butter to a boil until butter is melted.

- 1 cup flour

Remove from heat and add flour. Stir with a wooden spoon until the dough comes together. Return the saucepan to to medium heat and stir with the wooden spoon until a film develops on the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes.

- 4 large eggs

Transfer dough to an electric mixer. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Continue to beat the dough for 5 minutes.

- 2 tablespoons sweet paprika

Stir in the chorizo mixture and sweet paprika. Transfer to a pastry bag. Pipe dough into 1-inch balls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until lightly browned.
