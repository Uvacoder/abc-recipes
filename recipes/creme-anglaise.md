# Creme Anglaise

- 500 ml heavy cream
- 500 ml whole milk
- 1 vanilla bean

Combine milk and heavy cream. Scrape in seeds from vanilla bean. Bring to simmer and remove from heat.

- 250 g sugar
- 8 egg yolks

Whisk egg yolks and sugar.

Combine half of the cream mixture with the eggs and sugar blend. Slowly whisk together, and pour back into the rest of the cream mixture.

Let thicken over low heat (max. 85°C). It’s finished when your finger leaves a path on the back of your spoon.
Strain into bowl. Cover and chill.
